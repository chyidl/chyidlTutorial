* iMac G4 models support AirPort and Which support AirPort Extreme?
```
The original and "Spring 2003" iMac G4 models -- those with 800 MHz processors -- support AirPort (802.11b) -- and all subsequent models -- those with 1.0 GHz and 1.25GHz processors -- support AirPort Extreme (802.11g), but none had either wireless standard installed by default.
