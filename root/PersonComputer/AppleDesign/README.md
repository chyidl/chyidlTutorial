THE EVOLUTION OF APPLE DESIGN BETWEEN 1977-NOW
==============================================

> We're taking a look back in time at the evolution of Apple Products. Most have been notable leaps forward, while some were famous flops. Whether or not their inventions were accepted by the marketplace, Apple has consistently put out products that raise the bar for the computer and telecommunications industry.

> This list compiled for this article is by no means a complte compilationg of all Apple products. We chose to highlight those products where the design changes are best appreciated.

* All-In-One Computers 
> Apple has sold "all-in-one" computers that have built-in monitors from its very early days.Although some models were classified as All-In-One, they had separate monitors packaged in the same box.

* APPLE II-1977
> 1977 saw the invention of both the Apple II and the famous rainbow Apple Logo. Steve Jobs added the colours to the Logo to reflect the Apple II's superior colour output. Colour graphics set the Apple II aprt from its rivals on the market. Image: Wikipedia
