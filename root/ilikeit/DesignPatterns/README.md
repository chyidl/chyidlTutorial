Design Patterns
===============

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can 
be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an 
application or system.

Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm.

Uses of Design Patterns
-----------------------
Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that 
may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code 
readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.

In addition, patterns allow developes to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions. Common design patterns can be improved over time,
making them more robust than ad-hoc designs.


Be Careful
----------

* Design patterns are not a silver bullet to all your problems.
* Do not try to force them; bad things are supposed to happen, if done so.
* Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions to problems, not solutions finding problems; so don't overthink.
* If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be a savior; or else they can result in a horrible mess of a code.

Types of Design Patterns
------------------------

[Creational design patterns](/root/ilikeit/DesignPatterns/creational/README.md)
These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns.
While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to 
get the job done.

[Structural design patterns](/root/ilikeit/DesignPatterns/structural/README.md)
These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inferitance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define 
ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

[Behavioral design patterns](/root/ilikeit/DesignPatterns/behavioral/README.md)
These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.
