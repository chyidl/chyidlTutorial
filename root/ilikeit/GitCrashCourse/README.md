# Git + GitLab .vs GitHub

Version Control repository management services are a key component in the software development workflow. In the last few years, GitHub and GitLab positioned themselves as handy assistants for developers, particularly when working in large teams.


## Git explained

Both, GitLab and GitHub are web-based Git repositories.

The aim of Git is to manage software development projects and its files, as they are changing over time. Git stores this infomation in a data structure called a repository.

Such a git repository contains a set of commit objects and a set of references to commit objects.

A git repository is a central place where developers store, share, test and collaborate on web projects.

## The Basics of GitHub and GitLab 

GitHub is a Git based repository hosting platform. Public repositories on GitHub are often used to share open source software. Besides the basic code repository, GitHub can be used for issue tracking, documentation and wikis.

Similar to GitHub, GitLab is a repository manager which lets teams collaborate on code. Written in Ruby, GitLab offers some similar features for issue tracking and project management as GitHub. 


## Key differences and similarities: GitLab vs GitHub 

Authentication Levels: With GitLab you can provide access to issue tracker without giving permission to the source code. This is obviously great for larger teams and enterprises with role-based contributors.
