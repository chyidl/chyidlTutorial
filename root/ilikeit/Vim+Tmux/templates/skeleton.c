// 🎂"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels.
// The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.
// The ones who see things differently. They're not found 
// of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.
// You can quote them, disagree with them, glority or vilify
// them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. 
// Because they change things. They push the human race forward.
// And while some may see them as the creazy ones, we see genius.
// Because the poeple who are crazy enough to think thay can change
// the world, are the ones who do."
