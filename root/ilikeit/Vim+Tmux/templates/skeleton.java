// ðŸŽ‚"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels.

// You can quote them, disagree with them, glority or vilify
// them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. 
// Because they change things. They push the human race forward.
// And while some may see them as the creazy ones, we see genius.
// Because the poeple who are crazy enough to think thay can change
// the world, are the ones who do."
