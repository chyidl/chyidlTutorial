Problems: Voting on articles

Let's say that 1,000 articles are submitted each day. Of those 1,000 articles,
about 50 of them are interesting enough that we want them to be in the top-100
articles for at least one day. All of those 50 articles will receive at least
200 up votes. won't worry about down votes for this version.
