Indexing Patterns 
=================
> Conceptually, Redis is based on the key/value database paradigm. Every piece of data is associated with a key, either directly or indirectly. 

* Sorted sets as indexes
```
Sorted Sets (ZSETs) are a native Redis data type that can be thought of a set of unique members (repeates are not stored) with each member being attached to a number (termed score) that acts as a natural sorting mechanism.
