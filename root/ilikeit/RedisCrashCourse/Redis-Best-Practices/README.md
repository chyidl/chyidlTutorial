Redis Best Practices
====================

* Indexing Patterns
```
In the "Indexing Patterns" section we covert ways to go beyond key/value access with Redis. This includes ways to smartly use both specific keyspace patterns and the different structures in Redis to aid not only in finding data in your database, nbut to reduce access complexity.
```

* Communication Patterns 
```
With Communication Patterns the focus is on Redis patterns that move data around a system, In this way, Redis is not acting as a storage engine but rather a pathway of data. 
```

* Data Storage Patterns 
```
"Data Storage Patterns describes methods to store more complex data in Redis. We evaluate complex document scenaties that that can be generalized in simple or complex ways.
```

* Time Series Pattern 
```
Patterns concerning temporally related data are covered in the Time Series Pattern section 
```

* Basic Rate Limiting Pattern 
```
Rate limiting is a common use for Redis. in the Basic Rate Limiting Pattern section, we go over the fundamentals of this use case.
```

* Bloom Filter Pattern 
```
Bloom filters have long been associated with Redis and in the Bloom Filter Pattern section we covert both the uses of probabilistic data structure and how they differe from non-probabilistic counterparts.
```

* Counting
```
Counting is a surprisingly deep subject.In this section, we explore how to count activity and unique items in space and compuattionally efficient ways
