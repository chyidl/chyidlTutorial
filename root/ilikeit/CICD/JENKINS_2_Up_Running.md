Jenkins 2 Up & Running
======================

* Master
> A Jenkins master is the primary controlling system for a Jenkins instance.

* Node
> Node is the generic term that is used in Jenkins 2 to mean any system that can run Jenkins jobs.

* Agent
> An agent is the same as what earlier version of Jenkins referred to as a slave.

* Executor
> Related to all the previous systems are executors.

```
Just use node for Scripted Pipe-lines and agent for Declarative Pipelines.
