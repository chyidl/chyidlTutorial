# Multiple Postgres databases in a single Docker container 
> The PostgreSQL object-relational system provides reliability and data integrity.
> PostgreSQL implements the majority of the SQL:2011 standard, is ACID-compliant and transactional(including most DDL statements) avoliding locking issues using multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), provides immunity to dirty reads and full serializability; handles complex SQL queries using many indexing methods that are not available in other databases; has updateable views and materialized views, triggers, foreign keys; supports functions and stored pricedures, and other expandability, and has a large number of extensions written by third parties.
