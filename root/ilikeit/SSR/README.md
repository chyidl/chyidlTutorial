What is server-side rendering
=============================
> Server-side rendering (SSR), is the ability of an application to contribute by displaying the web-page on the server instead of rendering it in the browser. Server-side sends a fully rendered page to the client; the client's JavaScript bundle takes over and allows the SPA framwork to operate. 


What is a SPA framework?
-----------------------
> SPA stands for single page application. It means your application lives on one page and one page only. you would have static parts on the page like header and footer but some middle part that would changed based on for example selecting a menu option. 

```
Flickering and sluggish UI is what SPAs are here to solve. Back in the days when there were no SPA frameworks, an app would completely reload the page when going from one page to the next. With SPA frameworks we suddenly go client-like web applications.
