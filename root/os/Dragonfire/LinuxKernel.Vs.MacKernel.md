Linux Kernel Vs. Mac Kernel
===========================

> The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer's operating system, with complete control over everything in the system. On most systems, it is one of the first program loaded on start-up (after the bootloader). It handles the reset of start-up as well as input/output requests from software, transalating them into data-processing instructions for the central processing unit. It handles memory and peripherals like keyboards, monitors, printers, and speakers.
