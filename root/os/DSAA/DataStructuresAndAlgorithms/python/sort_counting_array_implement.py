Counting Sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range.It
works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values. Then doing
some arthmetic to calculate the position of each object in the output.

For simplicity, consider the data in the range 0 to 9.
Input data: 1, 4, 1, 2, 7, 5, 2
    1) Take a count array to store the count of each unique object.
        Index:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        Count:  0 2 2 0 1 1 0 1 0 0

    2) Modify the count array such that each element at each index stores the
    sum of previous counts.
        Index:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        Count:  0 2 4 4 5 6 6 7 7 7

The modified count array indicates the position of each object in the
the output sequence.
    3) Output each object from the input sequence followed by decreasing its
    count by 1
    Process the input data: 1, 4, 1, 2, 7, 5, 2. Position of 1 is 2. Put data
    1 at index 2 in output. Decrease count by 1 to place next data 1 at an
    index 1 smaller than this index.
