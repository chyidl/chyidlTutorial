# Because they change things. They push the human race forward.
# And while some may see them as the creazy ones, we see genius.

"""
Binary Search: Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval
in half. Begin with an iteraval convering the whole array. If the value of the
search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the
interval to the lower half. Other-wise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly
cheack until the value is found or the interval is empty.
