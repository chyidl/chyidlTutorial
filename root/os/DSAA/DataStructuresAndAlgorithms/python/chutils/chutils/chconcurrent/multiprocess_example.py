multiprocessing.Pool: When to use apply, apply_async or map

Pool.apply, Pool.map blocks until the complte result is returned

Pool.apply_async Pool of worker processes tp perform many function
calls asynchronously. The order of the results is not guaranteed to be
same as the order of the calls to Pool.apply_async.

Notice also that you could call a number of different functions with
Pool.apply_async (not all calls need to use the same function).

In contrast, Pool.map applies the same function to many arguments. However,
unlike Pool.apply_async, the results are returned in an order corresponding
to the order of the arguments.
