# The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.
# The ones who see things differently. They're not found
# of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.
# You can quote them, disagree with them, glority or vilify
# them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.
# Because they change things. They push the human race forward.
# And while some may see them as the creazy ones, we see genius.
# Because the poeple who are crazy enough to think thay can change
# the world, are the ones who do."

"""
Set up simple (async) aiohttp server.
The server is going to read full html text of Thinkdifferent.html. It will add
random delays between responses. Some responses will have zero delay, and some
will have maximum of 3 seconds delay. This should resemble real application,
few apps respond to all requests with same latency, usually latency differs
from response to response.
