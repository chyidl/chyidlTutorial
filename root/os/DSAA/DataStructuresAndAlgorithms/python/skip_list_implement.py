Skip list is a probabilistic data structure that allows efficient search,
insertion and removal operations. It was invented by William Pugh [1] 1989

On the other hand, skip lists are much like multiple linked lists with some
randomization.
The time complexity of skip lists can be reduced further by adding more layers.
In fact, the time complexity of search, insert and delete can become O(logn) in
average case with O(n) extra space.

Insert an Elements in Skip List

Deciding nodes level:
    randomLevel()
    lvl := 1
    // random() that returns a random value in [0...1]
    while random() < p and lvl < MaxLevel do
    lvl := lvl + 1
    return lvl

Node Structure
    Each node carries a key and a forward array carring pointers to nodes of a
    different level. A level i node carries i forward pointers indexed through
    0 to i

Insertion in Skip List
    start from highest level in the list and compare key of next node of the
    current node with the ley to be inserted. Basic idea is if -
        1. Key of next node is less than key to be inserted then we keep on
        moving forward on the same level
        2. Key of next node is greater than the key to be inserted then we
        store the pointer to current node i at update[i] and move one level
        down and continue our search

Following is the psuedo code for the insertion algorithm
    Insert(list, searchKey)
    local update[0...MaxLevel+1]
    x := list->header
    for i := list-level downto 0 do

Searching an element in Skip list
    Search(list, searchKey)
        x := list->header
        -- loop invariant: x-key < searchKey
        for i := list->level downto 1 do
            while x->forward[i]->key < searchKey do
                x := x->forward[i]
        -- x->key < searchKey <= x->forward[1]->key
        x := x->forward[1]
        if x->key = searchKey then return x->value
            else return failure

Following is the pseudo code for deletion
    Delete(list, searchKey)
        local update[1..MaxLevel]
        x := list->header
        for i := list->level downto 1 do
            while x->forward[i]->key < searchKey do
                x := x->forward[i]
            update[i] := x
        x := x->forward[1]
        if x->key = searchKey then
            for i := 1 to list->level do
                if update[i]->forward[i] != x then break
                update[i]->forward[i] := x->forward[i]
            free(x)
            while list->level > 1 and
                list->header->forward[list->level] = NIL do
            list->level := list->level - 1
