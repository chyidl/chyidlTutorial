"""
Recursion : The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly
is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive
function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite

The idea is represent a problem in terms of one of more smaller problems, and
add one or more base conditions that stop recursion.

What is the difference between direct and indirect recursion?

What is tail recursion?
    The tail recursive can be optimized by compiler.
"""


# A NON-tail-recursive function. The function is not tail recursive because the
# valye returned by fact(n-1) is used in fact(n) and call to fact(n-1) is not
# the last thing done by fact(n)
def fact(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * fact(n-1)


# Driver program to test above function
print(fact(5))


# The above function can be written as a tail recursive function.
def factTR(n, a):
    if n == 0:
        return a

    return factTR(n-1, n*a)


# A wrapper over factTR
def fact(n):
    return factTR(n, 1)
