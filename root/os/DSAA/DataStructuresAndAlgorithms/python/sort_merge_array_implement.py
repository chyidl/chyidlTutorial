Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides input array in two
halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves.

MergeSort(arr, l, r)
    if r > l:
        1. Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:
            middle m = (l + r)/2
        2. Call mergeSort for first half:
            Call mergeSort(arr, l, m)
        3. Call mergeSort for second half:
            Call mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)
        4. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
            Call merge (arr, l, m ,r)

Time Complexity: Sorting arrays on different machines. Merge Sort is a
recursive algorithm and time complexity can be expressed as following
recurrence relation.
    T(n) = 2T(n/2) + o(n)
Auxiliary Space O(n)
