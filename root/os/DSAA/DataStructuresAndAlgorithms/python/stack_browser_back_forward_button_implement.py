"""
Using to implement the back and forward button of a browser

Use Two Stacks for the forward and back. Since all you have a remember is the
last thing page you came from and the last page you came back from. One stack
will be for "undoing", i.e. Going backward to the page you were just at, and
one would be for "redoing"I.e.Going forward.
