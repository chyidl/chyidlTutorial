Circular Queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed
based on FIFO(First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected
back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer"

Operations on Circular Queue:
    Front: Get the front item from queue.
    Rear: Get the last item from queue.
    enQueue(value): This function is used to insert an element into the
        circular queue. In a circular queue. the new element is always inserted
        at Rear position.

        Steps:
            1. Check whether queue is Full - Check (
                (rear == SIZE-1 && front == 0)||(rear == front-1))
            2. If it is full then display Queue is full. If queue is not full
                then, check if (rear == SIZE-1 && font != 0) if it is true
                then set rear=0 and insert element.
    deQueue(): This function is used to delete an element from the circular
        queue.In a circular queue, the element is always deleted from front
        position.

        Steps:
            1. Check whether queue is Empty means check (front == -1).
            2. if it is empty then display Queue is empty, If queue is not
                empty then step3
            3. Check if (front == rear) if it is true then set front=rear=-1
                else check if (front==size-1), if it is true then set front 0
                and return the element.

Time Complexity: Time complexity of enqueue(), dequeue() operation is O(1) as
there is no loop in any of the operation.

Applications:
    1. Memory Management: The unused memory locations in the case of ordinary
        queues can be utilized in circular queues.
    2. traffic system: In computer controlled traffic system, circular queue
        are used to switch on the traffic lights one by one repeatedly as per
        the time set.
    3. CPU Scheduling: Operating systems often maintain a queue of process-es
        that are ready to execute or that are waiting for a particular envent
        to occur
