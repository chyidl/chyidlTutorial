Steve jobs say>: 
    to me, ...marketing is about values! This is a very complicated world. It's a very noisy world. AND We're Not going to get a change to get people to remember much about us. 
    No company is! and so we have to be really clear on what we want them to know about us. Now apple... fortunately.. is one of half-a-dozen best brands in the whole world.
    right up there with NIKE, DISNEY, COKE, SONY. It is one of the greats of the greats.Not just in this country. But all around the globe. But.. even a great brand needs investment and caring...
    if it's going to retain it's relevance and vitality. And the Apple brand has clearly suffered from neglegt. in this area in the last few years. and we need to bring it back! The way to do that
    is not to talk about speeds and fees. It's not to talk about bits and mega-hertz. It's not to talk about why we are better than windows. The dairy industru tried for 20 years to convince you that milk was good for you. It's a lie, but they tried anywayi. and the sales were falling. and then they tried "GOT MILK" AND the sales went up. Got milk wasn't even talking about the product in fact, it focuses on the absenge of the product. but the best example of all. and one of the greatest jobs of marketing. that the universe has ever seen, is nike. Remeber, nike sells a commondity, they sell shoes!!! and yet, when you think of nike. you feel something different than a shoe company. in their ads, as you know, they don't ever talk about the product. thet don't
    ever tell you about their air soles. and why they are better than reebok's air soles. what does nike do in there advertising? they honor great athletes. and they honor great athletics. that's 
    who they are, that's what they are about! apple spends a fortune on advertising. you'd never know it. so when i got here, apple just fired their agency. and there was a competition with 23 agencies that you know four years from now we would pick one. and we blew that up and we hired chiatday, that ad agency that i was fortunate enough to work with years ago. and created some award winning work. including the commercial voted the best ad ever made, 1984. (By advertising professionals) and we started working about eight weeks ago. and the question we asked was. 
    our customers want to know who is apple and what is it that we stand for where do we fit in this world? what we're about isn't marking boxes. for people to get their jobs done. although we do that well. we do that better than almost anybody. In some cases. but apple is about something more than that! apple are the core. it's core value. is that, we believe that people with passion.
    can change the world for the better. that's what we believe! and we have had the opportunity to work with people like that, we've had the opportunity to work with people like you. with software
    developers, with customers who have done it. in some big, and some small ways! and we believe that. In this world. People can change it for the better. and that those people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world are the ones that actuauly do! and so, what we're going to do in our first brand marketing gampaign in several years. is to get back to that 
    core value. a lot of
