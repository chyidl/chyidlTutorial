Golang Tutorial
===============

Install Golang
--------------
```
The first thing I did was install **golang** on Mac with Homebrew 
mac$ brew install golang 
linux$ sudo apt-get install golang

The second thing , export some paths in you .zshrc or .bashrc files for easy use. 
$ sudo vim ~/.zshrc 
add export GOROOT=~/Dev/GOROOT
```
