concurrent.futures -- Manage Pools Launching parallel tasks

The concurrent.futures module provides a high-level interface for
asynchronously executing callables.

    ThreadPoolExecutor: thread
    ProcessPoolExecutor: process

Thread, Process Both implement the same interface, which is defined by the
abstract Executor class.

The module provides two types of classes for interacting with the pools:
    Executors: are used for managing pools of workers.
    Futures: are used for managing results computed by the workers.
