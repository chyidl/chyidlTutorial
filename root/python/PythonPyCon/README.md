An exploration of what Python thread programming could be like if you gave it advanced features such as thread groups, cancellation, and more. An experimental library "thredo" is described and later revealed to be implemented on top of async [Curio](https://curio.readthedocs.org/) project.

### [![The Other Async (Threads + Asyncio = Love) Youtube Video](/imgs/python/PythonPyCon/other-async.png?raw=true)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ndXuw7S0s) Keynote: The Other Async (Threads + Asyncio = Love) 
In the world of concurrency, thread programming and asyncio are often considered separate lands--you either program with one or the other, but no both. In this live-coded talk, I show how to construct a queue object that works with any combination of threads or asyncio tasks using a common simple interface. This allows for a variety using a common simple interface. This allows for a variety of interesting programming techniques that beidge both wirlds. This is a somewhat
experimental talk, but the underlying foundation can be found in the [Curio](https://curio.readthedocs.org/) project.

This is the live-coding talk you were warned about. Starting from scratcg I discuss different concurrency models for Python with various coding examples. Topics include programming with threads, the infamous Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), event loops, and coroutine-based concurrency. This talk sets the stage for some of my later talks about asyncio, async/await, and asynchronous APIs.

### [![Python 3 Metaprogramming Youtube Video](/imgs/python/PythonPyCon/python3-meta.png?raw=true)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPiWg5jSoZI) Python 3 Metaprogramming 
A delightfully devilish tour through various metaprogramming features of Python. Includes decorators, class decorators, descriptors, metaclasses, import hooks and more. Although most of the topics also apply to Python 2, the tutorial covers a variety of features only found in Python 3. You might get fired if you apply too many of these things to the code at work.
