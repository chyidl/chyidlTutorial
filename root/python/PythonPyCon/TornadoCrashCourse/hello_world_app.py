# The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.
# The ones who see things differently. They're not found
# of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.
# You can quote them, disagree with them, glority or vilify
# them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.
# Because they change things. They push the human race forward.
# And while some may see them as the creazy ones, we see genius.
# Because the poeple who are crazy enough to think thay can change
# the world, are the ones who do."

Here is a simple "Hello, world" example web app for Tornado:
"""
import tornado.ioloop
import tornado.web


class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        self.write("Hello, world")


def make_app():
    return tornado.web.Application([
        (r"/", MainHandler),
        ])


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = make_app()
    app.listen(8888)
    tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current().start()
