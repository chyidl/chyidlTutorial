Set
---
```
Python's built-in set type has the following characteristics:
  Sets are unordered
  Set elements are unique. Duplicate elements are not allowed.
  A set itself may be modified, but the elements contained in the set must be of an immutable type.

A set creted in two ways:
  1. x = set(<iter>)
  2. x = {<obj>, <obj>}
```
