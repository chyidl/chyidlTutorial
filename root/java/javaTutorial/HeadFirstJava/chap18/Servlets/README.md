Servlets
========

> Servlets are Java programs that run on (and with) an HTTP web server. By far, the most common use of J3EE technology is to mix servlets and EJBs together, where Servlets are the client of the EJB. And in that case, the servlets is using RMI to talk to the EJBs.

> JSP stands for Java Server Pages. 
```
Servlet and JSP difference:
    Servlet: You write a Java class that contains HTML in the output statements 
    JSP: You write an HTML page that contains Java code!

RMI is part of the Java language, and all the classes for RMI are in the standard libraries. 
Servlet and JSPs are not part of the Java language; 

You can run RMI on any modern JVM, but Servlets and JSPs require a properly configured web server with a servlet "container".
