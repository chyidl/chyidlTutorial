Portable Computer Vision: TensorFlow 2.0 + OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi
===================================================================

* Goals
```
1. Deploy a pre-trained image classification model (MobileNetV2) using TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras 
2. Convert a model to TensorFlow Lite, a model format optimized for embedded and mobile devices.
3. Accelerate inferences of any TensorFlow Lite model with Coral's USB Edge TPU Accelerator and Edge TPU Compiler. 
4. Employ transfer learning to re-train MobileNetV2 with a custom image classifer.
